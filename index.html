            <p>
              During the past seven years, I've been working as a personal
              trainer, and during my free time, I'd always look at design and
              coding articles. I've always been interested in learning how to
              build fun and aesthetically pleasing websites. So I took a
              one-year break from personal training to pursue UI/UX design by
              attending Bloc's designer program. That was an excellent
              experience for me, and I learned a lot about what goes into
              creating a great user experience. After finishing the designer
              program, I went back to personal training to save up to take
              Thinkful's Engineering course to learn to implement these design
              mockups myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally, I'd like to be working in a full-stack role working
              closely with designers. By utilizing my knowledge of various
              front-end and back-end technologies, I'd like to help build
              applications that run as smoothly as possible for the end-user. I
              want to help craft user interfaces that are both beautiful and
              accessible as well.
