              The spaced repetition technique lets users focus on the words that

              over time, revisiting words they answer incorrectly. Words that
              users get right are revisited less and less frequently as users
              master them.

            <p>
              During the past 7 years, I’ve been working as a personal trainer
              and during my free time I'd always look at design and coding
              articles. I've always been interesting in learning how to build
              fun and aesthetically pleasing websites. So I took a 1 year break
              from personal training to pursue UI/UX design by attending Bloc's
              designer program. That was a great experience for me and I learned
              a lot about what goes into creating a great user experience. After
              finishing the designer program I went back to personal training
              top save up so I could take Thinkful's Engineering course so I
              could learn to implement these design mockups myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally I'd like to be working in a full-stack role working
              closely with designers. By utilizing my knowledge of various
              front-end and back-end technologies I'd like to help build
              applications that run as smoothly as possible for the end user.
              I'd like to help craft user interfaces that are both beautiful and
              accessible as well.
