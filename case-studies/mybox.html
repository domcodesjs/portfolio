          <p class="first-paragraph">
            There are so many competitors in the cloud storage industry and with
            big names like Google, Box, Amazon, and Dropbox, just to name a few,
            offering their own cloud storage solution you’d think there wouldn’t
            be room for another competitor to squeeze in. The goal with MYBOX is
            to disrupt this industry by offering a new pricing model.

            My client wants to enter the cloud storage industry and has tasked
            me to be the UX/UI designer to help bring this service to market. I
            was given a list of features the client would like in the app, as
            well as some features that are not mandatory. Besides the features
            the client has given me, I am responsible for discovering who the
            target audience is, completing branding and identity, and
            determining if the service should be for mobile devices as well as a
            web app for desktop browsers.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">
            The very first thing I did was a competitive analysis because I
            wanted to understand what it will take for our new service to
            compete on par with other cloud storage services and also find
            weaknesses in our competitors that we can exploit.
          </p>
          <p class="subsequent-paragraph">
            The chosen companies for the competitive analyses were Dropbox, Box
            and Google Drive. Overall, the competition had all the same basic
            features. But something I started to notice was the pricing for each
            of the competitors. They all were subscription based and this is
            where I started to realize there’s a better way to charge for
            storage space. Instead of charging a set amount per month for a
            finite amount of storage that you’re probably not going to max out
            on, why not charge for the storage space you’re using? That is the
            weakness that our service will exploit.

            Right after I conducted my competitive analysis I moved on to
            conducting a user survey on cloud storage. The reason I chose to
            conduct my user research after my competitive analysis was to learn
            more about cloud storage and to help me determine what questions I
            should be asking my survey respondents. Being able to ask the right
            questions will help me learn more about my end users and ultimately
            help me figure out target audience.

            the results of the survey I conducted as well as the user persona I
            created I was able to narrow down what features were important (on a
            scale from low, medium and high). I then used these results to help

            Up until now I haven’t had a solid idea of how the web app should be

            I began to brainstorm logo ideas for MYBOX, a lot of the biggest

            same which is why I decided to use the text MYBOX inside of a
            rectangle. The rectangle representing a box and the words MYBOX
            inside it showing that something is being stored in it. I kept the
            text minimal, using a thin weight for MY and a heavier weight for
            BOX to emphasize it.

            users didn’t like was the hierarchy of the dashboard, initially I
            bolded a lot of text and it threw some people off. But in the end I
            was able to take all the feedback I’ve gathered to create a better
            design.

          <h2>User Testing</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">
            I completed user testing on both my low fidelity prototype and high
            fidelity prototype. For each one I conducted at least 3 usablity
            tests with close friends and family. During my usability test for my
            low fidelity prototype I received pretty good feedback, users liked
            how simple it was to get started using the service and they loved
            the minimal layout. But during my usability test for my high
            fidelity prototype I received a lot of the same feedback and I
            thought this was great but then I presented my high fidelity
            prototype to an assessor.

          <p class="subsequent-paragraph">
            I aimed to go for a minimal feel for my design and I failed on that.
            I learned that I wasn’t getting quality feedback because the people
            I was conducting the usablity tests with most likely did not want to
            hurt my feelings even though I told them it would be okay. I took
            the feedback I received from my assessor and created a entirely
            brand new design but kept the same components. The redesign paid off
            and I conducted another usablity test and ultimately I started
            receiving better feedback as I was able to convince my participants
            to be straightforward with me about anything.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">
            Overall, working on this project has proven a difficult task. At
            first I couldn’t believe that I had to create a cloud storage
            service because in my head I was thinking there’s already so many
            big players in the industry, how can I hope to design a service that
            can compete with them? But as I continued to work through the
            project and follow my design process, I found that it’s possible.
            Every market has room for disruption, you just need to find your
            competitors weaknesses and exploit them and most importantly you
            need to always be thinking about your end users.

          <h3 class="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h3>
          <p class="subsequent-paragraph">
            MYBOX is my first attempt at designing a web app from scratch. The
            most important thing I’ve learned while creating MYBOX is having a
            design process is very important. If you try to design a product or
            service from scratch without doing any sort of user research then
            you’re relying on luck and your own opinions. Essentially you’d be
            designing a product or service for yourself and not your end users.
            So it’s very important to collect as much actionable data as
            possible about your users and to use that data to help you build an
            awesome user experience.
